                    He currently resides in Logan with

                    grabbing either his mountain or road bike and going for a long ride through the
                    countryside. At the same time, he relishes the competition of bike racing and 
                    professional cycling. When the weather is not so favorable, he also enjoys 
                    racquetball, skiing, and auto mechanics. </span>
