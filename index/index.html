                <h3>Lyle J. Fuller</h3>
                <img src="../assets/Lyle.jpg" alt="Lyle Fuller" loading="lazy">
                <p>
                    Lyle’s practice focuses on civil litigation, workers compensation defense, non-compete agreements and trade secrets, family law, and personal injury.  
                    He is an accomplished trial attorney who brings significant experience to all phases of the litigation process.  Lyle began his career as an associate 
                    in the litigation group of Spencer Fane, a large firm in Kansas City, Missouri.  Immediately prior to joining Fuller & Fuller, PLLC, he was a partner 
                    and member of the executive committee in the Salt Lake City law firm of Smith Hartvigsen.  Utah Business Magazine honored him as one of Utah’s Legal Elite 
                    in business litigation in 2008, 2009, and 2010, and Lyle was named a “Rising Star” by Mountain States Super Lawyers.  His article Keep Your Edge:  Non-compete 
                    Agreements Protect Business Assets appeared in the August 2009 issue of Utah Business Magazine.

                    <br>Lyle received his B.A. in History, magna cum laude, from Brigham Young University in 1997, and his law degree from Duke University in 2000, where he served as 
                    a research editor for the Duke Journal of Comparative and International Law.  In addition to being licensed in Idaho and Utah, he is also licensed (on voluntary inactive status) in Missouri and Kansas.  
                    When not practicing law, Lyle enjoys the outdoors, playing sports, watching Duke basketball, and spending time with his wife and four children.  He is also active in the community, serving on the board of the 
                    Oneida Stake Academy Foundation, and has served on the board of the Preston chapter of Kiwannis International.
